IRON FILE SYSTEMS
In this paper, IRON (Internal RObustNess) system which includes failure detection and recovery technology was created for file systems and applied to commercial file systems such as ext3 and ReiserFS.
The results showed that these file systems did not store duplicate information and there were some inadequate examples of how to recover from a disk failure.
The authors proposed a low-level redundancy technique and a small amount of redundancy to solve this problem, and to correct the disk failure.
In my opinion, most interesting thing is the changes made to the data and the parity block are updated at the same time.
This approach was applied to ext3, and as a result, they found that the disk errors were corrected in most cases, with a performance drop of 1-11% for daily use and 51% for benchmarks that focused on write testing. Found.
This paper contains very detailed information related to the research. So I think it is well-written paper.

Analysis and Evolution of Journaling File Systems
To analyze and evaluate recently used journaling-based file systems, the authors developed two approaches. 
The first is Semantic block-level analysis (SBA), which infers the behavior of a file system from the data structures and traces remaining on disk.
Another approach is semantic trace playback (STP) implemented as a user level process. It was implemented to complement the SBA. In this method, traces IO on disk using inputed trace.
The authors use these methods to confirm that some design decisions in ext3 and ReiserFS work inefficiently. 
In addition, several bugs were found, and it was reported to the develop group of file system to fix  in subsequent releases.
In this paper, they researched areas that were used in many fields but were not analyzed effectively. In other words, I think the research topic itself is good. 
The materials that support it are also easy to understand and detailed, so I enjoyed reading the paper.
