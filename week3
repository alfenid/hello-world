The Linux Scheduler: a Decade of Wasted Cores
In the scheduler used in Linux, four bugs have been found that do not make efficient use of multicore. 
As a result of this, certain cores remained idle for a long time even work queue is not empty, and 13-24% of the overall system was wasted. 
These bugs can be easily detected using the newly designed tools, rather than the existing ones.

Arachne: Core-Aware Thread Management
Arachne is a user-level thread management system that can be used without changing the kernel. 
These kind of user-level thread management system has been tried several times in the past, but Arachne has improved performance through new features, including the ability to estimate the number of cores required for each application to run, and minimizing chche misses. 
These characteristics enable users to achieve low latency and high throughput by applying Arachne.
