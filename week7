Everything you always wanted to know about synchronization but were afraid to ask
This paper analyzes the contents of synchronization from hardware to software and various architectures.
These analyzes was based on the multiple synchronization layer and are performed through evaluation of latency and atomic operations performance. 
For this analysis, they have developed SSYNC, a cross-platform synchronization suite, and they expect SSYNC to be used for future synchronization evaluation.
This may be due to a lack of relevant background knowledge, but overall, it was difficult to understand. Also lack of motivation was a disadvantage.

Read-Log-Update
RLU is an abbreviation of read-log-update, which is an extention version of RCU, a technique to reduce workload for lock in multicore environment.
Existing RCU has the disadvantage of being complicated to use and optimized for few wirters.
To overcome this problem, the author introduced two versions of the RLU. The implementation is different, but fundamentally these two implementations are based on the logging and coordination mechanism.
The newly implemented RLU method is configured to be used in a manner similar to the existing RCU method, and the reader-writer lock performance test using the RLU resulted in about 3 times faster results in the 16hardware threads environment.
They explained efficiently even there's subject was difficult.
Also, it is positive that it describes an idea that can be applied directly to the kernel.
