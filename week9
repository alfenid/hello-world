An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores
To analyzes the scalability of today operating system kernel, seven major applications was tested on a 48-core test device.
The author have configured a MOSBENCH set for testing to test scalability, and it was shared.
As a result, the paper concluded that the today kernel is not too hard to provide scalability with just a few changes. 
However, it is important to note that these results are provided without any bottlenecks caused by I / O.
It's a disadvantage that the scalability test was based only on MOSBENCH. 
Also, the premise is disadvantage that there is no bottleneck caused by I / O is necessary.
Other than that, I think it's a well-organized paper.

The Scalable Commutativity Rule: Designing Scalable Software for Multicore Processors
In general, scalability is measured by using a profiler to measure how much bottlenecks are occurring and how they are performing during the actual workload.
However, this approach has a complex interface, which makes it difficult to assess any scalability issues.
To solve this problem, author created a tool called COMMUTER that takes a simplified symbolic implementation as input and evaluates it for scalability.
Generated 13,664 tests using COMMUTER, It tested on the Linux kernel and the newly developed research kernel (SV6). 
As a result, we found 4275 scalability issues in the linux kernel and for the SV6, 136 tests confirmed the problem.
The details of the new tool COMMUTER were described in detail, ensuring the reliability of the test results. Another positive point is the problem of kernel was easy to understand. 
However, it was a disadvantage that the paper was difficult to understand.
