Ceph: A Scalable, High-Performance Distributed File System
Existing distributed file storage systems have problems of limited scalability from distributed design or performance degradation from centralized  design.
To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new file system named Ceph.
Ceph is a file system built on the assumption that it will run on a petabyte scale system. It is characterized by removing file allocation tables and separating metadata and data operations.
In addition, it provides excellent scalability by applying highly adaptive distributed metadata cluster architecture.
The authors provide an evaluation of performance and scalability to demonstrate Ceph's excellence, but the content is difficult for first-time readers of this paper. It is a disadvantage that this paper will have difficulty evaluating whether the claim is clear.

Barrier-Enabled IO Stack for Flash Storage
In order to perform an enforcing a storage order in Flash storage, another researchers are research to apply an algorithm based on Transfer-and Flush, which consumed a lot of resources.
To solve this problem, the paper suggest a Barrier-enabled IO stack that can call the next request even before the previous one is completed.
The Barrier-enabled IO stack is implemented based on the EXT4 file system, a modification to the fsync () function, and dual-mode journaling with fbarrier () and fdatabarrier.
This implementation allows applications to control storage order virtually without flush overhead, DMA transfer overhead, and much less journal commit latency. Experiments on MYSQL and SQLite show a file system with Barrier-Enabled IO Stack, about 43x and 73x faster than EXT4.
The downside is that it is too difficult to understand the content of the paper as a whole, but it seems very valuable in that it can be useful for designing faster file systems.
